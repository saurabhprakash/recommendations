## Purpose
Purpose of code is to calculate similarity between items. Uses term frequency â€“ inverse document frequency (also called tf-idf)

Code is being tested using news data(title and tags)
Sample input format: in file "sample_input" 

## Running code

To Run: python similarity_calculator.py

## Requirements

Python (3.5)

nltk (3.2.1)

numpy (1.11.1)

Understanding Input data : <id>###<string>###<tags list>
	id: is unique id for element
	string: string whose similarity needs to be calculated
	tags list: tags associated if any
